# Inline code blocks

`<script>` tags in **Astro** components are now built,
bundled and optimized by default.

> Markdown formatting still works between tags in inline code blocks.

We can also use closing `</script>` tags without any problems.

# Fenced code blocks

```html
<body>
	<div>This should also work without any problems.</div>
</body>
```
