# @astrojs/netlify

This adapter allows Astro to deploy your SSR site to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Learn how to deploy your Astro site in our [Netlify deployment guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/netlify/).

## Why Astro Netlify

If you're using Astro as a static site builder—its behavior out of the box—you don't need an adapter.

If you wish to [use server-side rendering (SSR)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/), Astro requires an adapter that matches your deployment runtime.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a deployment platform that allows you to host your site by connecting directly to your GitHub repository. This adapter enhances the Astro build process to prepare your project for deployment through Netlify.


## Installation

Add the Netlify adapter to enable SSR in your Astro project with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add netlify
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add netlify
# Using PNPM
pnpm astro add netlify
```

If you prefer to install the adapter manually instead, complete the following two steps:

1. Install the Netlify adapter to your project’s dependencies using your preferred package manager. If you’re using npm or aren’t sure, run this in the terminal:

    ```bash
      npm install @astrojs/netlify
    ```

1. Add two new lines to your `astro.config.mjs` project configuration file.

    ```js ins={3, 6-7}
    // astro.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify/functions';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: netlify(),
    });
    ```

### Edge Functions

Netlify has two serverless platforms, Netlify Functions and [Netlify's experimental Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/edge-functions/#app). With Edge Functions your code is distributed closer to your users, lowering latency.

To deploy with Edge Functions, use `netlify/edge-functions` in the Astro config file instead of `netlify/functions`.

```js ins={3}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify/edge-functions';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: netlify(),
});
```

## Usage

[Read the full deployment guide here.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/netlify/)

After [performing a build](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/#building-your-site-locally) the `netlify/` folder will contain [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) in the `netlify/functions/` folder.

Now you can deploy. Install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) and run:

```sh
netlify deploy --build
```

The [Netlify Blog post on Astro](https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-deploy-astro/) and the [Netlify Documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/astro/) provide more information on how to use this integration to deploy to Netlify.


## Configuration

To configure this adapter, pass an object to the `netlify()` function call in `astro.config.mjs` - there's only one possible configuration option:

### dist

We build to the `dist` directory at the base of your project. To change this, use the `dist` option:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify/functions';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: netlify({
    dist: new URL('./dist/', import.meta.url)
  })
});
```

And then point to the dist in your `netlify.toml`:

```toml title="netlify.toml"
[functions]
directory = "dist/functions"
```

### builders

[Netlify On-demand Builders](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/on-demand-builders/) are serverless functions used to build and cache page content on Netlify’s Edge CDN. You can enable these functions with the `builders` option:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import netlify from '@astrojs/netlify/functions';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: netlify({
    builders: true
  }),
});
```

On-demand Builders are only available with the `@astrojs/netlify/functions` adapter and are not compatible with Edge Functions.



### binaryMediaTypes

> This option is only needed for the Functions adapter and is not needed for Edge Functions.

Netlify Functions requires binary data in the `body` to be base64 encoded. The `@astrojs/netlify/functions` adapter handles this automatically based on the `Content-Type` header.

We check for common mime types for audio, image, and video files. To include specific mime types that should be treated as binary data, include the `binaryMediaTypes` option with a list of binary mime types.

```js {12}
// src/pages/image.jpg.ts

import fs from 'node:fs';

export function get() {
  const buffer = fs.readFileSync('../image.jpg');

  // Return the buffer directly, @astrojs/netlify will base64 encode the body
  return new Response(buffer, {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'image/jpeg'
    }
  });
}
```
