# @astrojs/solid-js üíô

This **[Astro integration][astro-integration]** enables server-side rendering and client-side hydration for your [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) components.

## Installation

There are two ways to add integrations to your project. Let's try the most convenient option first!

### `astro add` command

Astro includes a CLI tool for adding first party integrations: `astro add`. This command will:
1. (Optionally) Install all necessary dependencies and peer dependencies
2. (Also optionally) Update your `astro.config.*` file to apply this integration

To install `@astrojs/solid-js`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add solid
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add solid
# Using PNPM
pnpm astro add solid
```

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Install dependencies manually

First, install the `@astrojs/solid-js` integration like so:

```sh
npm install @astrojs/solid-js
```

Most package managers will install associated peer dependencies as well. Still, if you see a "Cannot find package 'solid-js'" (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, you'll need to install SolidJS:

```sh
npm install solid-js
```

Now, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

__`astro.config.mjs`__

```js ins={2} "solid()"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import solid from '@astrojs/solid-js';

export default defineConfig({
   // ...
   integrations: [solid()],
});
```

## Getting started

To use your first SolidJS component in Astro, head to our [UI framework documentation][astro-ui-frameworks]. You'll explore:
- üì¶ how framework components are loaded,
- üíß client-side hydration options, and
- ü§ù opportunities to mix and nest frameworks together
