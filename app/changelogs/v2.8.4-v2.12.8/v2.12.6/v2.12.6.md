### Development

Please cooperate to complete the following compatibility upgrades before mid-March:

1. Since the page does not refresh, you need to pay attention to the declaration of variables after switching out and then into the topic
2. window.destroyTheme is mainly used to remove js and css loaded by yourself; added dom; restore modified dom, etc. Just don't affect the next topic. Reference is as follows:
    ```
    window.destroyTheme = () => {
        document.querySelector("#theme-color-style").remove();
    }
    ```
