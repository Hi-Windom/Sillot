## Overview

All in all, this version is well worth the upgrade.

We recommend everyone to upgrade to this version as soon as possible, especially users who are using cloud data synchronization.

### Global search

Some users complained that the global search results were not complete, because we limited the number of search results and only displayed the most suitable search results.

Now we have removed this restriction, users can browse all search results through paged navigation.

### Data repo

Data repo is a very important function, which realizes data snapshot, data synchronization and backup. In this version, we have made substantial improvements to the data repo, mainly including:

* Support downloading cloud data snapshots to local on demand
* Support cleaning unreferenced data snapshots, the function entry is located in Settings - About - Data repo purge
* Improved data snapshot comparison
* Data snapshot saves device information

Support downloading cloud data snapshots to local on demand is a very important improvement. It allows users to download cloud data snapshots from any device at any point in time, providing more protection for data security.

It should be noted that the cloud data snapshot does not support displaying data snapshots synchronized by previous versions. Please update all devices to the latest version, and only after that can be added to the cloud data snapshot.

### Settings

As more and more configuration items are included in the settings, it becomes more and more difficult to find a configuration item. Now we have enhanced the search function in the settings, and you can quickly filter out configuration items through search.

In addition, we have also optimized the details of the setting interface to make it more beautiful.

### PWA install App

If you are using SiYuan through server hosting (such as a Docker), then you can install the application locally through the PWA, so that you can get an experience similar to a desktop application.

### Mobile

* Support cloud inbox
* Supports searching in the specified document, the function entry is in the document menu of the document tree
