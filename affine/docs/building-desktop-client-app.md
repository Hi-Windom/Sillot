## Prerequisites

Before you start building AFFiNE Desktop Client Application, please [install Rust toolchain first](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Note that if you encounter any issues with installing Rust and crates, try following [this guide (zh-CN)](https://course.rs/first-try/slowly-downloading.html) to set up alternative registries.

## Development

To run AFFiNE Desktop Client Application locally, run the following commands:

```sh

# in repo root
yarn install
yarn dev

# in apps/electron
yarn generate-assets
yarn dev
```

Now you should see the Electron app window popping up shortly.

## Build

To build the desktop client application, run `yarn make` in `apps/electron`.

Note: you may want to comment out `osxSign` and `osxNotarize` in `forge.config.js` to avoid signing and notarizing the app.

Once the build is complete, you can find the paths to the binaries in the terminal output.
