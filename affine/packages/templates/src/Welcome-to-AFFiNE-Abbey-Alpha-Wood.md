**Looking for Markdown syntax or keyboard shortcuts?**

- Find the (?) in the bottom right, then the Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è, to view a full list of Keyboard Shortcuts

### In this release, you can now:

- Manage your pages from the collapsible **sidebar**, which allows you to add **favorites** and restore deleted files from the **trash**
- Search through all your content with the quick search - activate with `Ctrl/‚åò + K`
  - A friendly Reminder:
    - In the case of unselected text, `Ctrl/‚åò + K` activates quick search;
    - In the case of selected text, `Ctrl/‚åò + K` will firstly ask to add a hyperlink, and then using `Ctrl/‚åò + K` again activates the quick search
- Quickly format text with the **pop-up toolbar** (highlight any text to give it a try)
- Copy and paste **images** into your pages, resize them and add captions
- Add horizontal line dividers to your text with `---` and `***`
- Changes are saved **locally**, but we still recommend you export your data to avoid data loss
- Insert code blocks with syntax highlighting support using `````

### Playground:

[] Try a horizontal line: `---`

[] What about a code block? `````

```JavaScript
console.log('Hello world');
```

[] Can you resize this image?
