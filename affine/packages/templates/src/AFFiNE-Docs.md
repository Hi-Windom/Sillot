## Get Started

This repo is split into folders - with each folder being a seperate category of documentation.

You can browse the folders to view the pages within each category.

Please note: Some pages may not display correctly on GitHub, be sure to check the corresponding page on GitBook.

### Asset Naming

All assets should be stored in `.gitbook/assets/`.

The asset should be named according to where it will be used.

If an image is needed for `/developer-docs/coding/setup.md` the expected filename would be `developer-docs_coding_setup` where `_` seperates each folder/file. And if multiple images are required a unique filename can be appeneded, such as `_01`.
